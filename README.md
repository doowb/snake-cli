> Experiment / demo using readline-utils to create a simple snake game in the terminal.

## Install

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm install --global snake-cli
```

## CLI

When installed globally, this module adds a `snake` command that will start the demo:

```sh
$ snake
```

## API

This module also exports a function that may be called manually to start the demo:

```js
var snake = require('snake-cli');
snake();
```

There are currently no options or configuration. This is just an demo to play around with some [readline-utils](https://github.com/enquirer/readline-utils) features.
