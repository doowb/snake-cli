## CLI

When installed globally, this module adds a `snake` command that will start the demo:

```sh
$ snake
```

## API

This module also exports a function that may be called manually to start the demo:

```js
var snake = require('snake-cli');
snake();
```

There are currently no options or configuration. This is just an demo to play around with some [readline-utils][] features.
